      <h2>where we started</h2>
      <p class="info">In 1951, fourteen families came together to form a company, with the desire to see their children raised up with good taste. It was a time of depending on ourselves and on each other. It was a time of chartering a new way to see the world. </p>

      <h2>our process</h2>
      
      
      <p class="info">We use Danish and Swedish modern design as the inspiration and starting off point for the collections. We were particularly drawn to the contrast between linear shapes and more fluid and round design sensibility, which we have explored through use of florals, plaids, and textures and seaming details</p>

        why we are better
      </h2>
        <p class="info">We are focused on creating sustainable livelihoods and an alternative to prostitution and poaching in a region of Kenya with the country's highest rates of unemployment. Beyond providing jobs, We regularly implement outreach in the neighboring community. One program is a stitching school and hub where women learn how to sew and can access the resources to become entrepreneurs. </p>

            We have a strong focus on women's empowerment, providing free childcare during work hours and a program for women to make and sell re-usable sanitary pads.
